            <h2> Drafting Table </h2>

            <p>
                This drafting table is - and acknowleging that this word is the worst - epic.
            </p>

            <h2> Drawers </h2>
            <p>
                All inside parts of the drawers are lined in red felt except for the top edge, which is instead covered with oak adhesive vaneer and staiend dark.
                This is a generally applicable technique, so we document all insights to help in future projects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The bottom felt is spray glued (super 77) to the drawer bottom. This is easy; just cut felt to size and glue.
                For the sides, we want to try to hide crimes as much as possible. So much like the dividers, we cover some material (0.125in hardboard) with felt and insert them against the sides (as pictured).
                A press fit here is preferable so we can remove the inserts in necessary. Here are some helpful notes:
                <ul>
                    <li>The felt cover adds a vertical dimension of about 0.125in (1/8), depending on how tight the wrap is</li>
                    <li>It adds a horizontal dimension of about 0.0625in (1/16)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
