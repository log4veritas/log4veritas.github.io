                    Perhaps the most iconic item out of From Software's <i>Bloodborne</i> is the Blood Vial.
                </p>

                <h2> Labels </h2>

                <p> 
                    The labels are interesting because we don't actually get to see them in game. The only image is very blurry, but some basic deetails are shown.
                    Since we don't know what the label says, there is a variety online, most of which aren't very good.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most people just take the item's in game description and print it out on digitally weathered paper, but that description would never be written on a
                    real product; it's far too anemic. In light of that, here are some variations of our Blood Vial label design. 
                    The lables with smaller text are meant to be printed larger, and would therefore require a larger bottle.
                    The images are .png and have no background for convenience. If a higer resolution image is available, click to view and/or download.

                <h2>The Bottle</h2>
                
                <p>
                    The bottle is probably the hardest part. It takes a while to find the correct size and shape, and would be very difficult to make from scratch. 
                    We found these nice 60ml x 40mm base x 75mm height glass bottles on Etsy that are close enough to the correct shape. 
                    They're quite small, but the name Blood <b>Vial</b> indicates to us that 60ml is a nice size.
