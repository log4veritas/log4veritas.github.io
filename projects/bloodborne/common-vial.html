                    Perhaps the most iconic item out of From Software's <i>Bloodborne</i> is the Blood Vial. So as Bloodborne lovers, we needed to add it to the collection.
                </p>

                <h2> Labels </h2>
                <p>
                    The labels are interesting because we don't actually get to see them in game. The only image is very blurry, but some basic deetails are shown.
                    Since we don't know what the label says, there is a variety online, most of which aren't very good.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most people just take the item's in game description and print it out on digitally weathered paper, but that description would never be written on a
                    real product; it's far too anemic and it simply doesn't make sense from a world building perspective. In light of that, here are some variations of our Blood Vial label design.
                    The lables with smaller text are meant to be printed larger, and would therefore require a larger bottle.
                    The images are .png and have no background for convenience. If a higer resolution image is available, click to view and/or download.

                <h2>The Bottle</h2>
                <p>
                    The bottle is probably the hardest part. It takes a while to find the correct size and shape, and would be very difficult to make from scratch.
                    We found these nice 60ml x 40mm base x 75mm height glass bottles on Etsy that are close enough to the correct shape.
                    They're quite small, but the name Blood <b>Vial</b> indicates to us that 60ml is a nice size.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <div class="content-image">
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GraveDesign/GraveDesign.github.io/main/images/resized/common-vial/vial2.png" width="300" />
                    </div>
                </p>

                <h2>The Blood</h2>
                <p>
                    The blood is fake, obviously, although some real blood was used on the label. We got a very ralistic blood by mixing the following ingredients until the end product looked correct.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Agave syrup, to make it thick</li>
                        <li>Red food coloring, obviously</li>
                        <li>Chocolate syrup (cacao power may also work), to add a bit of darkness</li>
                        <li>Corn starch, to make it more opaque and add more thickness</li>
                    </ul>
                    The only note on the blood is that some of the chocolate syrup might tend to settle at the bottom. It looks like a very accuarte blood clot,
                    but too much is bad. Just keep this in mind.
                </p>

                <h2>The Weathering</h2>
                <p>
                    The blood vial is most likely in a very old and beat up bottle, keeping with the general aesthetic of Bloodborne. Nothing in the game is in brand new condition.
                    The hunter might reuse the glass vials, filling them back up at the workbench after use, and so they should be dirty and scratched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we weather the bottle by taking some sandpaper to the glass and scratching it up. The cork is weathered with black acrylic paint.
                    Soon after the paint is applied, we wipe it off to leave more in the cracks than what is left on the surface.
                    This technique gives a really realistic dirty look. Finally, the label is soaked in black tea and pressed dry to age it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Blood Vial projects online are quite lazy, as implied above, and the labels are generally the worst part. Most people just print them out with a brown background.
                    This takes away a lot of the realism. Please, if you make your own vial, print it on a nice textured linen or cotton paper and age it with tea and coffe.
                    Try to crete light areas and dark areas. Uniformity is the enemy of weathering; randomness is paramount.
                </p>

                <h2>Extras</h2>

                <p>
                    The logo we used is an edit of the Healing Church logo from the game. Those parts are available here.
