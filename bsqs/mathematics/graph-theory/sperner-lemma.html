            <h2> Sperner's Lemma </h2>
                        
                <p>The two-dimensional case is the one referred to most frequently. It is stated as follows:</p>
                <p>Subdivide a triangle $ABC$ arbitrarily into a triangulation consisting of smaller triangles meeting 
                    edge to edge. Then a Sperner colouring of the triangulation is defined as an assignment of three 
                    colours to the vertices of the triangulation such that</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each of the three vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ of the initial triangle has a distinct colour</li>
                        <li>The vertices that lie along any edge of triangle $ABC$ have only two colours, the two 
                            colours at the endpoints of the edge. For example, each vertex on $\overline{AC}$ must 
                            have the same colour as $A$ or $C$.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Then every Sperner colouring of every triangulation has at least one "rainbow triangle", a 
                    smaller triangle in the triangulation that has its vertices coloured with all three 
                    different colours. More precisely, there must be an odd number of rainbow triangles.

            <h3>Proof</h3>

                <p>Consider a graph $G$ build from the triangulation $T$ as follows:</p>
                <p>The vertices of $G$ are the members (sub-triangles) of $T$ plus the area outside the 
                    triangle. Two vertices are connected with an edge if their corresponding areas share 
                    a common border with one endpoint coloured 1 and the other coloured 2 (for arbitrary 
                    colours 1 and 2).</p>
                <p>There must be an odd number of borders coloured $1-2$ on the edge $\overline{AB}$ simply 
                    because $A$ would be coloured 1 and $B$ coloured 2. Therefore, the vertex of $G$ 
                    corresponding to the outer area in $T$ always has an odd degree. </p>
                <p>The Handshaking Lemma states that in a finite graph there is an even number of vertices 
                    with an odd degree. Therefore the remaining graph excluding the outer area has an odd 
                    number of vertices with an odd degree; i.e., at least one vertex with odd degree.</p>
                <p>Clearly, the only possible degrees of a triangle from $T$ is $0,1,2$ and the degree 
                    $1$ corresponds  to a triangle coloured with the three colours $1,2,3$ (degree 
                    $0$ corresponds  to a triangle with no $2$ colourings, degree $2$ corresponds  
                    with no $3$ colourings).</p>
                <p>Then it must be the case that there is always a triangle coloured $1,2,3$, 
                    and taking the slightly stronger conclusion, there is always an odd number 
                    of such triangles.</p>
                <p><i>Note:</i> The multi-dimensional case is proved by induction on the dimension 
                    of a simplex.</p>

            <h4>The Handshaking Lemma</h4>    
                
                <p>The Handshaking Lemma states that in every finite graph there must be an even 
                    number of vertices for which $deg(v)$ is an odd number.</p>
                    $$\sum_{v\in V}deg(v_i)=2|E|$$
                <p>Each edge is incident to exactly two vertices. The degree of each vertex is defined 
                    as the number of edges to which it is incident. So when we add up the degrees of 
                    all the vertices, we are counting all the edges of the graph twice.</p>
