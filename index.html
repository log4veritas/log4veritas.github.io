                log4veritas is exactly that: a collection of knowledge and experience accross many
                different topics and disciplines.
                This website is split into two parts.
                The first section, AMPC, holds information about the objects we create.
                The other section is BSQS, a vast library containing the theory and
                technical knowledge required to make the objects detailed in AMPC (plus a lot more).

                <i>The Archivum de Machinator, Propositium, et Creatio</i> (AMPC), meaning <i>The Archive of Engineering, Design, and Creation</i>,
                is a complete guide to the objects we make.
                It is not a "how-to" guide, but more of a description of "what happened", as Adam Savage would say.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this section of the website, you will find complete descriptions of all our original builds, notes and insights we found along the way,
                plus all the supporting material, 
                whether that be a 3D model, a photoshop file, or a G-code file, it's all here. The original builds are almost always accompanied with lots of pictures.
                Remember, this website is about sharing information. Our work is your work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the original builds, there are also a host of prop replicas in here. 
                You will find reference images, research, and descriptions of each of these replicas.
                And as with the original builds, all supporting files and documents can be found here.

                <i>The Bibliotheca Scire Quod Sciendum</i>, which roughly translates from latin to <i>The Library of Knowlege Which is Worth Knowing</i>,
                holds all the theory, the reference materials, textbook solutions, automatic calculators, the list goes on.
                It is meant to be a treasure trove of information, always growing as we gain more knowlege.
            </p>

            <p>
                The information here is theoretical in nature. Best practices and techniques are usually described in AMPC; however, there may be some
                overlap between it and the Engineering section in BSQS. This is unfortunately unavoidable.
            </p>

            <p>
                BSQS is organized first by identifying the overarching subject, and then branching off into the various sub-topics.
                Everything is in a place that makes sense. Sometimes the same file is listed under two separate sub-topics, and that's ok.
                It gives the library a more complete feel, as the characterization  of a file is not always black and white. Inter-disiplinary
                projects are somewhat common, and so they should be available to the user no matter which component of the project they thought of first.
