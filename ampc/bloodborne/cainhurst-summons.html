            <h2> Cainhurst Summons </h2>

            <p>
                The cainhurst summons is an easy paper prop replica out of From Software's <i>Bloodborne</i>.
                As with many other Bloodborne objects, we don't know many of the fine details.
                For example, here we can barely make out the text on the letter. We will have to come up with something that could feasibly fit inside this universe.
                This requires a deep dive into the lore of Canhurst and the Vileblood royal family.
                See further below for the letter graphic.
            </p>

            <h2> Parts </h2>

            <p>
                The graphic below is printed on the envelope (click for full resolution). Try to get it as close to the edges as possible.
                The envelope should be rectangular and have a pointed flap that comes down to about the vertical midpoint.
                This should be printed on both sides. Decreasing the opacity to about 60% gave a nice effect in the final version.
            </p>

                Below is the graphic which is printed on the letter itself (click for full resolution). The text is left as a separate layer for convenience.
                The black should be printed at full opacity and the crest in the middle printed at 60% opacity.
                A thicker cardstock paper is appropriate here.

                For doing CNC cuts or 3d prints (as we did for the wax seal), here are two .svg vector files of the Vileblood Crest, one detailed and the other more simplified.
                At the bottom of this page, we also include some other file types for download (e.g., .stl, .dxf)

            <h2>Wax Seal</h2>
            <p>
                The Cainhurst Summons in the game obviously has a wax seal on the front.
                A close look reveals that it is the same back-to-back lion symbol embossed in the seal.
                It is what we have dubbed the Vileblood Crest.
                After some trial and error, we successfully created a wax seal stamp with the negative of the seal etched into it. Images are below.
                We used a slightly less detailed version of the cainhurst crest to achieve the
            </p>

            <p>
                The cut was done on a CNC router using a 60 deg cone bit with a 0.125 in shank. This was running at 10,000 rpm with a 4.5 in/min feed rate, 3 in/min plunge rate, and taking 0.003 in per pass.
                The stamp was cut out of 0.125 aluminum. The outer diameter of the shape is 1.100 in, and we engraved 0.027 in deep.
            </p>

            <p>
                And yes, the image of the wax seal here is not using the correct type of wax. It might get updated later.

            <h2>Note</h2>
            <p>
                The note is illegible, so we will have to come up with something that seems correct. However, the sing off at the bottom right is barely legible.

            <p>
                It seems like the letter is signed off with the phrase <i>Live Together, Die Alone</i>. Weird and creepy in classis Bloodborne fashion.
