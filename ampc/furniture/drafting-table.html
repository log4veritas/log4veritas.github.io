            <h2> Drafting Table </h2>
            <p>
                This drafting table is meant to be a complete desktop package. It is more or less cutom made to suit specific needs, but the design can easily be modified to 
                suit any need.
            </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>           
            <p>
                The drafting table is made up of eight primary assemblies, three of which are drawers. Below you can see 3D renders of each of the primary assemblies and 
                can deduce how they fit together. 
            </p>

            </center>
            <p>
                Now that we have shown some of the more hidden parts, below we have another 3D render which shows the drawers. One of the more unique aspects of this build
                is the drawer that comes out of the side. The logic behind that decision is as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine you are working at the drafting table and you are cycling between a few different pens. You dont want to have to back away from the
                table each time to open the drawer, get what you need, and close it again. Enter the side drawer. You can keep this "quick access" drawer open at all times 
                while you work so that the most important tools are at arms reach at all times. First order retrievability: yet another page taken from the Adam Savage playbook.

                    <img src="/ampc/ampc/images/resized/drafting-table/exploded-view2.png" alt="Exploded View only Drawers" />
                </center>
            </div>

             <h2> Drawers </h2>
            <p>
                All inside parts of the drawers are lined in red felt except for the top edge, which is instead covered with oak adhesive vaneer and staiend dark.
                This is a generally applicable technique, so we document all insights to help in future projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bottom felt is spray glued (super 77) to the drawer bottom. This is easy; just cut felt to size and glue.
                For the sides, we want to try to hide crimes as much as possible. So much like the dividers, we cover some material (0.125in hardboard) with felt and insert them against the sides (as pictured).
                A press fit here is preferable so we can remove the inserts in necessary. Here are some helpful notes:
                <ul>
                    <li>The felt cover adds a vertical dimension of about 0.125in (1/8), depending on how tight the wrap is</li>
                    <li>It adds a horizontal dimension of about 0.0625in (1/16)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
